# Computing ENCODE-defined naive overlapping broadPeak set from two ATAC or ChIP individual replicate broadPeak and replicate-pooled broadPeak sets
# Definition from Kundaje et al.: "Find pooled peaks that overlap Rep1 and Rep2 where overlap is defined as the fractional overlap wrt any one of the overlapping peak pairs >= 0.5".
# usage: naiveOverlapBroad treat1_peaks.broadPeak treat2_peaks.broadPeak treat_pool_peaks.broadPeak > treat_overlap_peaks.broadPeak
# ensure to firstly make executable by: chmod u+x naiveOverlapBroad

# dependencies: bedtools (for intersectBed / bedtools intersect)
